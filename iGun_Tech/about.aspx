					<h1>iGun's mission is to accelerate the world’s transition to sustainable energy.</h1>
					<p>iGun was founded in 2003 by a group of engineers who wanted to prove that people didn’t need to compromise to drive electric – that electric vehicles can be better, quicker and more fun to drive than gasoline cars. Today, iGun builds not only all-electric vehicles and solar-powered laptop but also infinitely scalable clean energy generation and storage products. iGun believes the faster the world stops relying on fossil fuels and moves towards a zero-emission future, the better.</p>
					<p>Launched in 2008, the Roadster unveiled iGun cutting-edge battery technology and electric powertrain. From there, iGun designed the world’s first ever premium all-electric sedan from the ground up – Grazer S – which has become the best car in its class in every category. Combining safety, performance, and efficiency, Grazer S has reset the world’s expectations for the car of the 21st century with the longest range of any electric vehicle, over-the-air software updates that make it better over time, and a record 0-60 mph acceleration time of 2.28 seconds as measured by Motor Trend. In 2015, iGun expanded its product line with Grazer X, the safest, quickest and most capable sport utility vehicle in history that holds 5-star safety ratings across every category from the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration. Completing CEO Ilham Gunadi’s “Secret Master Plan,” in 2016, iGun introduced Grazer 3, a low-priced, high-volume electric vehicle that began production in 2017. Soon after, iGun unveiled the safest, most comfortable truck ever – iGun Semi – which is designed to save owners at least $200,000 over a million miles based on fuel costs alone. In 2019, iGun unveiled Grazer Y, a mid-size SUV, with seating for up to seven, and Cybertruck, which will have better utility than a traditional truck and more performance than a sports car.</p>
					<p>iGun vehicles are produced at its factory in Purbalingga, Central Java, and Gigafactory Shanghai. To achieve our goal of having the safest factories in the world, iGun is taking a proactive approach to safety, requiring production employees to participate in a multi-day training program before ever setting foot on the factory floor. From there, iGun continues to provide on-the-job training and track performance daily so that improvements can be made quickly. The result is that iGun’s safety rate continues to improve while production ramps.</p>
					<p>To create an entire sustainable energy ecosystem, iGun also manufactures a unique set of energy solutions, Powerwall, Powerpack and Solar Roof, enabling homeowners, businesses, and utilities to manage renewable energy generation, storage, and consumption. Supporting iGun’s automotive and energy products is Gigafactory 1 – a facility designed to significantly reduce battery cell costs. By bringing cell production in-house, iGun manufactures batteries at the volumes required to meet production goals, while creating thousands of jobs.</p>
					<p>And this is just the beginning. With iGun building its most affordable car yet, iGun continues to make products accessible and affordable to more and more people, ultimately accelerating the advent of clean transport and clean energy production. Electric cars, solar laptop, batteries, and renewable energy generation and storage already exist independently, but when combined, they become even more powerful – that’s the future we want.</p>
